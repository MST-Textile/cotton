        <p>But seriously, unfortunately we couldn't find the page you are &mdash; were &mdash; looking for. The page could have resigned, is on a coffee break, or if it's Monday, the page usually comes two hours late to work.</p>
        
        <p>You could try to hit the <a href="/">homepage</a>, or go and take a cup of coffee &mdash; you deserve it. You can take a class of milk too, if you aren't in for coffee jitters. Milk is good for your bones, I've heard, unless you are a hedgehog. If you are a coin-loving hedgehog, definitely stay clear of any dairy products, please.</p>
