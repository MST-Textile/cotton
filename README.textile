p. Trying to bring back some fresh seed of life to "rah_textile_bar's":https://github.com/gocom/rah_textile_bar Textile editor JavaScript. Dream would be have no dialogs, smart buttons, multi-line support, only one heading and one codeblock button. An editor should make editing easier and user-friendlier, not slower.
